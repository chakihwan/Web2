    <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?</p><br><br>
    <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br><br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <br><br>printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br><br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br><br>typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br><br>Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software <br><br>like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h1>Where does it come from?
    </h1><br><br>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has <br><br>roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard <br><br>McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one <br><br>of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going <br><br>through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <br><br>
        <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for <br><br>those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero<br><br> are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions <br><br>from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
